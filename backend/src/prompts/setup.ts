const RANDOM_HEROES_PROMPT = `
  You are a Dungeons & Dragons 5e character creator. 
  Generate a party of {{partySize}} heroes that fit the following setting and story context:

  SETTING: {{settingTitle}}
  STORY INTRO: {{storyPrompt}}
  TONE: {{tone}}

  For each hero, provide the following:
  1. **Name**  
  2. **Race** (and subrace if applicable)  
  3. **Class**  
  4. **Gender**  
  5. **Personality Summary** (1-2 sentences)  
  6. **Background & Motivation** (3-5 sentences — why they adventure, where they come from)  
  7. **Appearance** (1-2 sentences — notable features, clothing, etc.)  
  8. **Signature Equipment / Item** (1-2 key items or weapons that represent them)  
  9. **Party Role** (what purpose they serve in the team — e.g., healer, scout, strategist, tank, etc.)

  Keep the party diverse in race, class, and background. 
  Make sure their stories intertwine slightly — they should feel like they belong in the same world and could naturally work together.

  Return the result as a **JSON object** in the following format (without Markdown or code blocks):

  {
    "heroesText": "A short narrative summary (5-8 sentences) that highlights each hero's name, race, class, gender, personality, background, appearance, equipment and role in a smooth, natural storytelling tone.",
    "heroesList": [
      {
        "name": "",
        "race": "",
        "class": "",
        "gender": "",
        "personality": "",
        "background": "",
        "appearance": "",
        "equipment": "",
        "role": ""
